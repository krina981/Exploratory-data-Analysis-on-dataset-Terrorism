# Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism Dataset
## Overview
Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Terrorism Dataset project! This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks for conducting an in-depth analysis of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The project aims to gain insights into global terrorism trends, patterns, and characteristics using data visualization and statistical techniques.

## Terrorism Dataset
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an extensive dataset that records incidents of terrorism worldwide. It contains detailed information on terrorist attacks, including the date, location, target type, attack type, casualties, and other relevant attributes. The dataset spans several decades and covers various terrorist activities carried out by different groups and individuals.

## Goals
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Data Exploration: Perform an initial exploration of the terrorism dataset to understand its structure, size, and content.
Temporal Analysis: Analyze terrorism trends over time to identify any patterns or changes in attack frequencies.
Geospatial Analysis: Visualize the geographical distribution of terrorist attacks to identify hotspots and regions with high terrorism activity.
Target and Attack Type Analysis: Investigate the types of targets and attack methods employed by terrorists.
Casualty Analysis: Examine the impact of terrorist attacks on human lives and property by analyzing the number of casualties.
Perpetrator Analysis: Explore the identity and affiliations of terrorist groups or individuals responsible for the attacks.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the raw dataset files (if not too large) or links to the dataset source.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
src/: Python scripts containing reusable functions for data processing and visualization.
results/: Saved visualizations, summary statistics, and intermediate datasets.
report/: A detailed report summarizing the findings and insights from the analysis.
requirements.txt: A list of required Python libraries for reproducing the analysis.
## Usage
To reproduce the EDA on the terrorism dataset, you will need Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file:

## bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
After installing the required libraries, you can run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory in sequence to conduct the exploratory analysis step-by-step. The notebooks will guide you through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are highly encouraged. If you discover any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new analyses, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
This project is made possible by the Global Terrorism Database and its contributors, who have collected and maintained valuable data on terrorism incidents worldwide. We would like to express our gratitude to them for providing this essential resource for research and analysis.
